# rl-social-media-engagment
A reinforcement learning agent intended to maximize engagement on Twitter by means of liking, retweeting, following, and more.

These four different bot accounts would randomly explore and exploit via two different methods that are randomly chosen based on the "epsilon" of each bot.

The projected is now completed and the bots are no longer active, however this was a very interesting introduction to reinforcement  learning and its implementation.

I also have a personal interest in how AI has been used to manipulate social media to promote certain ideas, so this was a fun project to mess around with.

This repository is based off a previously made private repository that was modified to be safe for public view.
